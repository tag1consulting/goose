# Type-Safe Client Builder Implementation for Goose

## Overview
This document details the complete implementation of a type-safe client builder pattern that replaces the conditional compilation approach in PR #578 for the Goose load testing framework. The implementation provides compile-time safety while maintaining all performance optimizations and ensuring zero breaking changes.

## Background
- **Original PR**: #578 introduced cookie disable functionality using conditional compilation
- **Problem**: Complex `#[cfg(feature = "cookies")]` blocks scattered throughout codebase
- **Solution**: Type state pattern with phantom types for compile-time safety

## Implementation Details

### Core Files Created/Modified

#### 1. `src/client.rs` (New File - 14.3KB)
**Purpose**: Core type-safe client builder implementation

**Key Components**:
- `CookiesEnabled` and `CookiesDisabled` type states
- `GooseClientBuilder<State>` with phantom types
- `ClientStrategy` enum for different client creation approaches
- `GooseClientConfig` for client configuration
- Helper functions for creating clients with/without cookies

**Type Safety Features**:
- Cookie methods only available on `CookiesEnabled` state
- Compile-time prevention of invalid configurations
- Seamless state transitions with `.with_cookies()` and `.without_cookies()`
- Zero-cost abstractions using `PhantomData`

**Strategy Pattern**:
```rust
pub enum ClientStrategy {
    Individual(GooseClientConfig),  // One client per user (cookies enabled)
    Shared(Arc<Client>),           // Single shared client (cookies disabled)
}
```

#### 2. `src/lib.rs` (Modified)
**Changes Made**:
- Added `client_strategy: Option<ClientStrategy>` field to `GooseAttack`
- Implemented `.set_client_builder_with_cookies()` method
- Implemented `.set_client_builder_without_cookies()` method
- Modified client creation logic in user spawn loop to use strategies
- Maintained full backward compatibility

**Integration Points**:
- Line ~756: Client creation logic updated to check strategy
- Methods added for setting client builders
- Default behavior unchanged when no client strategy set

#### 3. `src/prelude.rs` (Modified)
**Changes Made**:
- Exported new types: `GooseClientBuilder`, `CookiesEnabled`, `CookiesDisabled`
- Made types available for public API usage

#### 4. `tests/client_builder.rs` (New File - 8.3KB)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test suite for type-safe client builder

**Test Coverage** (13 tests total):
- Type state transitions and safety
- Method chaining functionality
- Client strategy creation (Individual vs Shared)
- Compile-time safety demonstrations
- GooseAttack integration
- Functional load tests with both cookie states
- Performance optimization verification
- Configuration integration
- Default behavior preservation

## Technical Architecture

### Type State Pattern Implementation
```rust
pub struct GooseClientBuilder<State = CookiesEnabled> {
    config: GooseClientConfig,
    _state: PhantomData<State>,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Compile-time enforcement of valid API usage
- Zero runtime overhead
- Clear API boundaries
- Impossible to call cookie methods on cookies-disabled clients

### Performance Optimization Strategy
1. **Individual Strategy**: Creates separate `reqwest::Client` per user with full cookie support
2. **Shared Strategy**: Creates single `reqwest::Client` shared across all users (no cookies)

**Memory Impact**:
- Individual: Higher memory usage (one client per user)
- Shared: Lower memory usage (single client for all users)
- Same optimization as original PR #578

## Usage Examples

### Default Behavior (Unchanged)
```rust
GooseAttack::initialize()?
    .register_scenario(scenario!("Test").set_host("http://localhost"))
    .execute().await?;
```

### Individual Clients with Custom Configuration
```rust
GooseAttack::initialize()?
    .set_client_builder_with_cookies(
        GooseClientBuilder::new()
            .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
            .user_agent("my-loadtest/1.0")
    )
    .register_scenario(scenario!("Test").set_host("http://localhost"))
    .execute().await?;
```

### Optimized Performance (Shared Client)
```rust
GooseAttack::initialize()?
    .set_client_builder_without_cookies(
        GooseClientBuilder::new()
            .without_cookies()
            .timeout(Duration::from_secs(15))
    )?
    .register_scenario(scenario!("Test").set_host("http://localhost"))
    .execute().await?;
```

### Type Safety Demonstration
```rust
// ✅ This compiles - cookie methods available on CookiesEnabled state
let cookies_enabled = GooseClientBuilder::new()
    .cookie_store(true)  // Available
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30));

// ❌ This would NOT compile - cookie methods not available on CookiesDisabled
// let invalid = GooseClientBuilder::new()
//     .without_cookies()
//     .cookie_store(true);  // Error: method not found

// ✅ State transitions work seamlessly
let transitioning = GooseClientBuilder::new()
    .cookie_store(true)      // Available on CookiesEnabled
    .without_cookies()       // Transition to CookiesDisabled
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(20))  // Available on both
    .with_cookies()          // Transition back to CookiesEnabled
    .cookie_store(true);     // Available again
```

## Test Results

The type-safe builder pattern provides a clean foundation for:
- Additional client configuration options
- More sophisticated connection pooling
- Custom authentication strategies
- Request/response middleware
- SSL/TLS configuration options
