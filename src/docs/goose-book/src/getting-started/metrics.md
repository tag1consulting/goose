# Metrics

Here's sample output generated when running a loadtest, in this case the [Umami example](../example/umami.html) that comes with Goose.

In this case, the [Drupal Umami demo](https://www.drupal.org/docs/umami-drupal-demonstration-installation-profile) was installed in a local container. The following command was used to configure Goose and run the load test. The `-u9` tells Goose to spin up 9 users. The `-r3` option tells Goose to hatch 3 users per second. The `-t1m` option tells Goose to run the load test for 1 minute, or 60 seconds. The `--no-reset-metrics` flag tells Goose to include all metrics, instead of the default which is to flush all metrics collected during start up. And finally, the `--report-file report.html` tells Goose to generate an HTML-formatted report named `report.html` once the load test finishes.

## Metrics reports
In addition to the above metrics displayed on the CLI, we've also told Goose to create reports on other formats, like Markdown, JSON, or HTML.

It is possible to create one or more reports at the same time, using one or more `--report-file` arguments. The type of report is chosen by the file extension. An unsupported file extension will lead to an error.

The following subsections describe the reports on more detail.

### HTML report

#### Overview
The HTML report starts with a brief overview table, offering the same information found in the [ASCII overview](#ascii-metrics) above:
![Metrics overview](metrics-overview.jpg)

**NOTE:** The HTML report includes some graphs that rely on the [eCharts JavaScript library](https://echarts.apache.org). The HTML report loads the library via CDN, which means that the graphs won't be loaded correctly if the CDN is not accessible.

#### Requests
Next the report includes a graph of all requests made during the duration of the load test. By default, the graph includes an aggregated average, as well as per-request details. It's possible to click on the request names at the top of the graph to hide/show specific requests on the graphs. In this case, the graph shows that most requests made by the load test were for static assets.

Below the graph is a table that shows per-request details, only partially included in this screenshot:
![Request metrics](metrics-requests.jpg)

#### Response times
The next graph shows the response times measured for each request made. In the following graph, it's apparent that POST requests had the slowest responses, which is logical as they are not cached. As before, it's possible to click on the request names at the top of the graph to hide/show details about specific requests.

Below the graph is a table that shows per-request details:
![Response time metrics](metrics-response-time.jpg)

#### Status codes
All status codes returned by the server are displayed in a table, per-request and in aggregate. In our simple test, we received only `200 OK` responses.
![Status code metrics](metrics-status-codes.jpg)

#### Transactions
The next graph summarizes all Transactions run during the load test. One or more requests are grouped logically inside Transactions. For example, the Transaction named `0.0 anon /` includes an anonymous (not-logged-in) request for the front page, as well as requests for all static assets found on the front page.

Whereas a Request automatically fails based on the web server response code, the code that defines a Transaction must manually return an error for a Task to be considered failed. For example, the logic may be written to fail the Transaction of the html request fails, but not if one or more static asset requests fail.

This graph is also followed by a table showing details on all Transactions, partially shown here:
![Transaction metrics](metrics-transactions.jpg)

#### Scenarios
The next graph summarizes all Scenarios run during the load test. One or more Transactions are grouped logically inside Scenarios.

For example, the Scenario named `Anonymous English user` includes the above `anon /` Transaction, the `anon /en/basicpage`, and all the rest of the Transactions requesting pages in English.

It is followed by a table, shown in entirety here because this load test only has 3 Scenarios. The `# Users` column indicates how many `GooseUser` threads were assigned to run this Scenario during the load test. The `# Times Run` column indicates how many times in aggregate all `GooseUser` threads ran completely through the Scenario. From there you can see how long on average it took a `GooseUser` thread to run through all Transactions and make all contained Requests to completely run the Scenario, as well as the minimum and maximum amount of time. Finally, `Iterations` is how many times each assigned `GooseUser` thread ran through the entire Scenario (Iterations times the # of Users will always equal the total # of times run).

As our example only ran for 60 seconds, and the `Admin user` Scenario took >30 seconds to run once, the load test only ran completely through this scenario one time, also reflected in the following table:
![Scenario metrics](metrics-scenarios.jpg)

#### Users
The final graph shows how many users were running at the various stages of the load test. As configured, Goose quickly ramped up to 9 users, then sustained that level of traffic for a minute before shutting down:
![User metrics](metrics-users.jpg)

### Markdown report

The Markdown report follows the structure of the [HTML report](#html-report). However, it does not include the chart elements.

### JSON report

The JSON report is a dump of the internal metrics collection. It is a JSON serialization of the `ReportData` structure. Mainly having a field named `raw_metrics`, carrying the content of [`GooseMetrics`](https://docs.rs/goose/latest/goose/metrics/struct.GooseMetrics.html).

### Developer documentation
Additional details about how metrics are collected, stored, and displayed can be found [in the developer documentation](https://docs.rs/goose/*/goose/metrics/index.html).

## Baseline deltas

It is possible to use a previously generated JSON report as a baseline for reports. In addition to the actual values, this will then also show the difference from the last.

To use this, you will need to:

* Create a baseline report by running it at least once using `--report-file report.json`
* Then start adding `--baseline-file report.json` to later runs

It is possible to still keep generating a JSON report at the same time as using a baseline file. So that you can
create the next basefile in the same step.
