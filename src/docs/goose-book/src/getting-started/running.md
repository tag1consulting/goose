# Running A Load Test

We will use Cargo to run our example load test application. It's best to get in the habit of setting the `--release` option whenever compiling or running load tests.

```bash
$ cargo run --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.23s
     Running `target/release/loadtest`
Error: InvalidOption { option: "--host", value: "", detail: "A host must be defined via the --host option, the GooseAttack.set_default() function, or the Scenario.set_host() function (no host defined for LoadtestTransactions)." }
```

The load test fails with an error as it hasn't been told the host you want to load test. So, let's try again, this time passing in the `--host` flag. We will also add the `--report-file` flag, [which will generate a HTML report](common.html#writing-an-html-formatted-report). The same information will also [be printed to the command line](metrics.md) (without graphs). After running for a few seconds, press `ctrl-c` to stop the load test:

```bash
$ cargo run --release -- --host https://drupal-memcache.ddev.site --report-file=report.html
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/release/goose_attack --host 'https://drupal-memcache.ddev.site' --report-file=report.html`

^C16:33:18 [WARN] caught ctrl-c, stopping...
```

When the load tests finishes shutting down, the HTML report will be created in the local directory and named `report.html` as configured above. The report includes the following sections:

![HTML report header section](report_header.png)

By default, Goose will hatch 1 `GooseUser` per second, up to the number of CPU cores available on the server used for load testing. In the above example, the server has 8 CPU cores, so it took 7 seconds to hatch all users. After all users are hatched, Goose flushes all metrics collected during the hatching process (use the `--no-reset-metrics` flag to disable this behavior) so all subsequent metrics are taken with all users running. Before flushing the metrics, they are displayed to the console so the data is not lost.

![HTML report request metrics section](report_request_metrics.png)

The per-request metrics are displayed first. Our single transaction makes a `GET` request for the `/` path, so it shows up in the metrics as `GET /`. The table in this section displays shows the total number of requests made (2,499), the average number of requests per second (208.25), and the average number of failed requests per second (0). 

Additionally it shows the average time required to load a page (39.68 milliseconds), the minimum time to load a page (19 ms) and the maximum time to load a page (180 ms).

If our load test made multiple requests, the Aggregated line at the bottom of this section would show totals and averages of all requests together. Because we only make a single request, this row is identical to the per-request metrics.

![HTML report response times metrics section](report_response_metrics.png)

The second section displays the average time required to load a page. The table in this section is showing the slowest page load time for a range of percentiles. In our example, in the 50% fastest page loads, the slowest page loaded in 36 ms. In the 70% fastest page loads, the slowest page loaded in 41 ms, etc. The graph, on the other hand, is displaying the average response time aggregated across all requests. 

![HTML report transactions metrics section](report_transaction_metrics.png)

Next comes per-transaction metrics, starting with the name of our Scenario, `LoadtestTransactions`. Individual transactions in the Scenario are then listed in the order they are defined in our load test. We did not name our transaction, so it simply shows up as `0.0`. All defined transactions will be listed here, even if they did not run, so this can be useful to confirm everything in your load test is running as expected. Comparing the transaction metrics metrics collected for `0.0` to the per-request metrics collected for `GET /`, you can see that they are the same. This is because in our simple example, our single transaction only makes one request.

In real load tests, you'll most likely have multiple scnearios each with multiple transactions, and Goose will show you metrics for each along with an aggregate of them all together.

Refer to the [examples](../example/overview.html) included with Goose for more complicated and useful load test examples.
